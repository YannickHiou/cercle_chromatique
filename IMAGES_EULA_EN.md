# EULA — End User License Agreement

## Parties
- **Provider**: Yannick Hiou (hereinafter "Provider").  
- **User**: the person or entity using the software (hereinafter "User").

## Purpose
This agreement governs the use of images generated by the software provided by the Provider.  

The source code of the program is distributed under the GNU GPL v3 license; this EULA does not modify the license of the code itself.  

The images are produced using a color table and three parameters Rt, Rs and Rp, which are the radii of concentric circles separating the areas of tertiary, secondary and primary colors.  
The original configuration sets Rt to 200, and calculates Rs and Rp so that the surface area of tertiary colors is three times that of primary colors, and the surface area of alternating secondary colors is twice that of primary colors, which contributes to a certain balance in the design.
Any other color table and combination 0 < Rp < Rs < Rt constitute an acceptable parameterization and allow the program to generate the images covered by this EULA.

## Intellectual Property
The Provider retains all rights, title and interest in the images generated by the software (hereinafter "Images"). The Images are not covered by GPL v3 and are not licensed to the User under it.

## License to Use the Images
- Subject to full compliance with the terms of this EULA, the Provider grants the User:

- Any reproduction, distribution, modification, publication or other commercial exploitation of the Images without prior written authorization is prohibited, unless expressly stated otherwise in a separate agreement.

## Restrictions
- Prohibition on reselling, redistributing or sublicensing the Images without written authorization (except for the personal and non-commercial use permitted above).  
- Prohibition on claiming to be the author of the Images or removing any proprietary notices.

## Warranties and Liability

- The Provider's liability is limited to cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, within the limits provided by applicable law.

## Term and Termination

- The Provider may immediately terminate the license in the event of a material breach of the terms by the User. Upon termination, the User ceases all use of the Images and deletes all copies.

## Miscellaneous Provisions
